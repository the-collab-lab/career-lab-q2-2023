# Requirements 

## About You

**You have substantial experience with Web APIs.** In this role, you'll be building integrations against partners' APIs. You'll need to know and love Web APIs.

**You are a skilled programmer.** You donâ€™t expect to come up with designs and leave implementation to others. Instead, you dig in and get stuff done. You'll be working in Python and/or Node on a day to day basis.

**You are a skilled written communicator.** Zapier is a 100% remote team and writing is our primary means of communication. You can communicate unfamiliar technical topics clearly and in an approachable way.

**You want to do what's best for users.** Integrations are at the core of Zapier's value to our customers, and we want to keep building ones that are of the highest quality and solve our customers' needs.

**You enjoy helping others learn from your experience.** You'll love assisting other engineers to learn from your background and will be continually looking to learn new things yourself.

**You understand that perfect is the enemy of the good.** One of our core values is defaulting to action. You can ship code and systems that just work and work simply, while iterating as needed to get towards better solutions.

## Things You Might Do

Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:

* Build and maintain Apps on the Zapier platform for crucial APIs
* Migrate applications to new APIs as the need arises
* Talk to partner engineers about changes to APIs and impacts that might have on Zapier customers
* Help the team build tooling to help other app developers and help Zapier scale to 1000s of developers using the Zapier platform
* Help other engineers on the team and across Zapier
* As a part of Zapier's all-hands philosophy, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.
* Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change as we experiment with doing more custom partnership work

## How To Apply

We have a non-standard application process. To jump-start the process we ask a few questions we usually would ask at the start of an interview. This helps speed up the process and lets us get to know you a bit better right out of the gate.

After you apply, you are going to hear back from us, even if we don't seem like a good fit. In fact, throughout the process, we strive to make sure you never go more than seven days without hearing from us.
