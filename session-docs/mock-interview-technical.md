# Sync: Technical mock interview

Each Collabie will be paired with a mentor for the technical mock interview.

The interviews will run a maximum of 1 hour, including time for you to ask questions about the role and company as well as time for the mentor to give feedback on the content and style of your responses.

<aside>
💻 <strong>Technical interviews</strong> are designed to assess the level of your technical skills. These interviews can take many formats. Sometimes they are a review of a take-home assignment you’ll have completed ahead of time. Sometimes they might involve “white-boarding” a technical solution on the spot. These interviews also typically include more general questions about programming and problem-solving.

## Interview preparation

- Collabies will reach out to their assigned mentor to schedule the interview.
- Collabies will send the interviewer their completed take-home assignment.
- Interviewers will use [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17m_A_cinlrju0H1KfNcodWgv1Dh8gsW-v5emcHSEjjA/edit) to review the Collabie's take-home assignment and get prepared to discuss their work in the interview.
- Review the [Technical interview questions](../resources/technical-interview-questions.md)

- Review the take-home assignment with the Collabie: have the Collabie demo the assignment and ask them questions about the work **[20 minutes]**
