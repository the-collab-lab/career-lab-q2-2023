# Technical interview questions

During a technical interview, it is fairly common to be asked to walk through a piece of code the interviewee has written, often times this will be in the form of a take-home assignment that the company has provided to them.

As part of Career Lab, Collabies will work through [this take-home assignment](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/career-lab-challenge-next) and review that code during a mock interview, in addition to covering some general software engineering questions (listed below).
