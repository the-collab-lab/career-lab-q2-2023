# Sync: Job-fit mock interview

Each Collabie will be paired with a mentor for a job-fit interview.

The interviews will run a maximum of 1 hour, including time for you to ask questions about the role and company as well as time for the mentor to give feedback on the content and style of your responses.

<aside>
🤝 <strong>Job fit interviews</strong> typically happen early in the recruiting process. They are designed to assess whether you have the background and skills needed for the open role. They may also attempt to assess your alignment to the company’s values and culture.

## Interview preparation

- Collabies will reach out to their assigned mentor to schedule the interview.
- Mentors will send the Collabie a job description from their own company so that the Collabie knows what role they are interviewing for. This will help simulate a more realistic interview experience. If you do not have access to a job description, you can use this one:

  [Engineer Job Description](../resources/mock-job-description.md)

- Review the [Job fit interview questions](../resources/job-fit-interview-questions.md)
- Collabies should [prepare some questions to ask the interviewer](what-to-ask-your-interviewers.md) about the job and company.

## Interview agenda

- General job-fit interview questions from the [Job fit interview questions](../resources/job-fit-interview-questions.md) **[30 minutes]**
- Time for Collabie to ask questions about your work, the job opportunity they are applying for, and company. When Collabies ask these questions, mentors should just respond as if the Collabie is interviewing for a role at their current company. **[10 minutes]**
- Debrief and provide feedback **[20 minutes]**
