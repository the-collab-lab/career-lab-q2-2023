# Sync: Technical mock interview

Each Collabie will be paired with a mentor for the technical mock interview.

The interviews will run a maximum of 1 hour, including time for you to ask questions about the role and company as well as time for the mentor to give feedback on the content and style of your responses.

<aside>
üíª <strong>Technical interviews</strong> are designed to assess the level of your technical skills. These interviews can take many formats. Sometimes they are a review of a take-home assignment you‚Äôll have completed ahead of time. Sometimes they might involve ‚Äúwhite-boarding‚Äù a technical solution on the spot. These interviews also typically include more general questions about programming and problem-solving.

## Interview preparation

- Collabies will reach out to their assigned mentor to schedule the interview.
- Collabies will send the interviewer their completed take-home assignment.
- Interviewers will use the rubric linked in the orientation email to review the Collabie's take-home assignment and get prepared to discuss their work in the interview. [Questions specific to the Take Home Assignment](../session-docs/complete-take-home-assignment.md)
- Opptional additional [Generic technical interview questions](../resources/technical-interview-questions.md)

## Interview agenda

- Review the take-home assignment with the Collabie: have the Collabie demo the assignment and ask them questions about the work.  **[20 minutes]**
- General technical questions from the rubric **[10 minutes]**
- Time for Collabie to ask questions about your work, the job opportunity they are applying for, and company. When Collabies ask these questions, mentors should just respond as if the Collabie is interviewing for a role at their current company. **[10 minutes]**
