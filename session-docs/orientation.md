# Sync: Career Lab Kickoff

# Let’s do this! Let’s get you that first/next tech job!!!

Your mentors have been working super hard to put together a program we think is going to kick start your job search. We couldn’t be more excited to spend the next 2 weeks of Career Lab helping get you to a spot where you make a good first impression to recruiters and hiring managers!

Career Lab is a combination of presentations, videos, reading materials, and practical sessions where you’ll have the opportunity to practice the skills you need to succeed in interview situations in a safe environment where you’ll receive constructive feedback about your performance.
