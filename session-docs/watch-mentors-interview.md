# Sync: Watch our mentors interview each other 😅

We thought it would be helpful for you to see how a professional web developer answers questions in an interview format, so we’re going to role play 2 interviews live for the group. This won’t be stressful at all! 😅

There are 2 common types of interviews that most companies do: job fit and technical. 

> **Job fit interviews** typically attempt to assess whether the person has the general background, skills, and attitude to be successful in the open role. 


> **Technical interviews** are geared towards determining the technical skill level of the applicant.

# Job fit

[NAME] will interview [NAME] in a mock job fit interview.

# Technical

[NAME] will interview [NAME] in a mock technical interview, spending most of the time reviewing the take home assignment.
